\titledquestion{Array Section: Maximal Power}

Given a sequence of positive integers $A=\langle a_1,\cdots,a_n\rangle$, we want to divide it into several consecutive sections so that the sum of power of these sections 
is maximized.

The power of section $\langle a_i,\cdots,a_j\rangle$ is defined as $aX_{i,j}^2+bX_{i,j}+c$, where
\begin{itemize}
    \item $a,b,c$ are given constants.
    \item $X_{i,j}=\sum\limits_{k=i}^j a_k$ is the sum of values in the section.
\end{itemize}

Please design a \textbf{dynamic programming} algorithm that returns the maximal sum of power of the sections that you divided.

For example, if \(a=-1,b=10,c=20\) and \(A=\langle 2,2,3,4\rangle\), the maximal sum of power is \(9\), and the way to divide the sequence is: \(\langle 2,2\rangle,\langle 3\rangle,\langle 4\rangle\).

\begin{parts}
\part[3] Define the subproblems for $i\in[0,n]$: $OPT(i)=$ the maximal sum of power of if you only consider dividing the first $i$ elements. Give your Bellman equation to solve the subproblems.

\part[1] What is the answer to this question in terms of $OPT$?

\part[3] What is the runtime complexity of your algorithm? (answer in $\Theta(\cdot)$)

\textbf{Hint:} How will you compute $X_{j,i}$ in $\Theta(1)$ time? Please give your analysis of the preprocessing and computing complexity.
